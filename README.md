### 🛤️ My Journey

My curiosity started in school, where I loved chess, business, and tech.  
I was always interested in how things work behind the scenes.  
After college, I chose to pursue this path professionally—starting as a **UX Designer**, then transitioning into **Software Engineering**.

Today, I combine design thinking, coding, and strategy to help brands simplify their tech and scale their impact.
